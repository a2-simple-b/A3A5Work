What went well
Similar to previous assessments I believe that communication and organisation went well.
Project Meetings helped the team stay on track and provide a ground level understanding of tasks to be completed within timeframes. This time we set deadlines for specific content to ensure that tasks were not being completed last minute.
What could be improved –
Focus on deliverables could be improved as they are generally time consuming to create. Our project idea was advanced and required a lot more research and development compared to others which had resulted in more time being spent. Despite being out of our comfort zone this project Idea was well worth it.
 At least one thing that was surprising 
Unfortunately, a team member had left our group towards the end. This was surprising as we had almost finished this subject and were almost at the finish line.

 At least one thing that you have learned about groups –
This assessment has reinforced my belief that communication within the group is the most important factor. Having a team member leave the group and not notify other team members in time had an impact on changing job roles to cover that specific team members workload.
