At the beginning of this course, I did not think that 12 weeks later I would be presenting a project on Educational machine learning. I am grateful that I joined a group of professional, motivated and hard-working students that put together a product that we can all be proud of. I have learned many new skills along the way such as navigating github and understanding its common uses with repositories, pull requests, branches and files. 
I have also gained confidence that I was otherwise lacking when I contributed to the team video. I am an introvert who would rather not participate in anything that showed me on camera but I enjoyed rehearsing my lines and being part of the overall exercise. With different personalities, paths and interests, I was surprised that the course had a fair amount of group assignments but I think we handled it quite well. We had a few hurdles with a tragedy in my family and also the departure of a group member, however we stuck it out and share the load of work needed to finalise our project. Overall, I feel my group members Ian, Chris and Charles brought out the best of me during this course.
