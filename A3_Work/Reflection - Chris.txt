I still cannot believe how fast the past 12 weeks have gone by, from knowing nothing about technology to having a basic knowledge of IT was a fruitful. I was assigned to a supportive team of amazing 4 individuals and lucky to have them throughout the semester. 

The final assignments include a video and report-based presentation. At first with the experience from previous assignments, we proceed with the storyboard and script with caution and quickly constructed a decent draft for the team to work with. While one of the group members having some personal issues and dropped out of the subject, with Ian’s great effort, we managed to stay on track to finish the required work. 

Having little knowledge of IT on my end was a challenge for the team and I felt like I may have dragged the team’s performance for a bit. I did my best to make it up by offered help on other tasks, hopefully I managed to take some loads off my teammates. 

This Mentor idea was brilliant and I can really see this project takes off in the near future where more and more people utilise the internet to study and I look forward to seeing what this project can bring to benefits the general public.
